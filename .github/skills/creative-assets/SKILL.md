# Creative Assets

Use this skill for any sourcing, generation, or integration of visual or audio assets in the repo.

## Agentic vs. Human Boundaries

| Task | Agent | Human |
|---|---|---|
| Generate pixel art from emoji | ✅ full | — |
| Write/save SVG from scratch | ✅ full | — |
| Source + vet a raster image URL (license, dimensions) | ✅ | — |
| Download binary PNG/JPG to `public/` | ❌ | ✅ always |
| Write attribution stub + handoff note | ✅ | — |
| Run audio fetch script | ✅ (invoke CLI) | — |
| Verify visual quality of downloaded art | ❌ | ✅ always |
| Verify audio quality / audibility | ❌ | ✅ always |

When a step is marked ❌ agent, pause and write a handoff note instead of silently skipping it or pretending it was done.

## Scenario Router

| Task | Go to |
|---|---|
| Source a photo, illustration, icon, texture, badge, or NASA image | [references/art-source-notes.md](./references/art-source-notes.md) |
| Generate pixel art from an emoji for a game scene or sprite | [references/pixel-art-workflow.md](./references/pixel-art-workflow.md) |
| Source or evaluate a CC0 sound effect | [references/audio-source-notes.md](./references/audio-source-notes.md) |
| Fetch, trim, and bundle approved audio samples | [scripts/fetch-game-audio.ts](./scripts/fetch-game-audio.ts) — see **Audio Fetch Tool** below |

## Shared Principles

- **CC0 or public domain only.** Verify the license explicitly before download. Do not assume; open the license page and confirm.
- **File-size budget.** Raster images ≤ 60 KB per asset. SVGs ≤ 8 KB. Audio one-shots ≤ 64 kbps mono OGG with tight trims.
- **Attribution required.** Every third-party asset must have an entry in `ATTRIBUTIONS.md` via the per-game data file in `app/data/attributions/`. Run `npm run sync:attributions` after updating.
- **Match the visual or sonic language** of the game. External assets that feel generic or out-of-register hurt cohesion more than they help.
- **Minimize processing passes.** Evaluate the rendered file after the real filter or optimization chain, not just a raw preview.

---

## Attribution Format

Entries in `app/data/attributions/<game-slug>.ts` follow this shape (from `ATTRIBUTIONS.md`):

```
- Type: <sound effect | music | image | other>
- Used in: <brief description of where it appears in the game>
- Creator: <creator name or handle>
- Source: <title> (<full URL>)
- License: Creative Commons 0 (<https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>)
- Modifications: <brief description, or "None">
- Notes: <optional clarifying context>
```

## Unified Preferred Sources

### Visual assets
- **Wikimedia Commons** — photos, illustrations, public-domain art, historical works
- **Openverse** — broad CC0/public-domain search across Wikimedia and Flickr
- **NASA** — space imagery, mission badges, crew portraits (U.S. government work, public domain)
- **game-icons.net** — CC0 SVG game icons
- **OpenGameArt.org** — CC0 sprites, tilesets, and decorative game art
- Public-domain vector archives and in-repo redraws when external assets are close but not quite right

### Audio assets
- **Freesound** — filter explicitly to CC0 (not just Creative Commons; select "CC0" in the license filter)
- **NASA audio** — rocket, mission, and space environment recordings (public domain)
- DIY recordings when no good CC0 candidate exists

## Audio Fetch Tool

The fetch script stages raw previews and renders final OGG variants per game.

```
# List approved samples for a game
npx tsx .github/skills/creative-assets/scripts/fetch-game-audio.ts --game <slug> --list

# Regenerate one approved sample
npx tsx .github/skills/creative-assets/scripts/fetch-game-audio.ts --game <slug> --only <sample-id> --yes

# Regenerate all approved samples for a game
npx tsx .github/skills/creative-assets/scripts/fetch-game-audio.ts --game <slug> --yes
```

Requires `FREESOUND_API_KEY` in `.env` and `ffmpeg` on `PATH`.

Staged raw previews accumulate under `.github/skills/creative-assets/.sound-staging/<game>/`.

Currently routes:
- `mission-orbit` → `public/mission-orbit/audio/`
- `chompers` → `public/chompers/audio/`

Extend the `gameAudioConfigs` map in the script as other games add sample manifests.

## Pixel Art Generator

```
npm run generate:pixel-art -- --emoji "🗼" --name parisTower --width 20 --height 14 --max-colors 6
npm run generate:pixel-art -- --codepoints 1F5FC --name parisTower --width 20 --height 14 --max-colors 6
```

See [references/pixel-art-workflow.md](./references/pixel-art-workflow.md) for size targets, tuning levers, and the integration pattern.

## Post-Integration Checklist

1. Asset saved under the correct game or public folder.
2. File size within budget (raster ≤ 60 KB, SVG ≤ 8 KB, audio ≤ 64 kbps mono).
3. Attribution data file updated; `npm run sync:attributions` run.
4. For audio: per-game sample manifest and service-worker cache list updated; cache name bumped if bundled bytes changed.
5. Build passes and page budget checks green.
