# Review

Use this skill for substantial work in this repository.

## Load These References

- Load [architecture](./references/architecture.md) for project structure, stack, build flow, game module contract, and implementation conventions.
- Load [game quality](./references/game-quality.md) for layout, pacing, orientation, and sourcing expectations.
- Load [testing](./references/testing.md) for test organization, validation gates, CI behavior, and attribution sync requirements.
- Load [security](./references/security.md) for secret-handling, review-before-push, and remediation expectations when credentials or generated env files are involved.

## Usage Notes

- Start with the reference most relevant to the task instead of loading everything blindly.
- For feature work touching gameplay or layout, load both architecture and game quality.
- For test changes or release-readiness, load testing as well.
- For anything involving push readiness, env files, third-party APIs, or discovered credentials, load security as well.
